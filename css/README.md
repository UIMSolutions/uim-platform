**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is a fundamental component of web development that allows you to style and format web pages.

**Purpose of CSS**:

- CSS is used to alter the **appearance** of HTML elements on a web page. It enables you to control how elements like text, images, and layout are presented to users.
- By applying CSS rules, you can change font styles, colors, spacing, layout, and even add animations and decorative features.

**How CSS Works**:

- CSS is a **rule-based language**. You define rules by specifying styles that should be applied to specific elements or groups of elements.
- For example, you can decide that all main headings (`<h1>`) should appear as large red text. Hereâ€™s a simple CSS rule:
- In this rule, weâ€™ve set the color to red and the font size to 2em (relative to the default font size).

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 2em;
}
```

**Separation of Concerns**:

- CSS allows you to separate **style** from **content**. HTML defines the structure and content of a page, while CSS handles the visual presentation.
- This separation makes it easier to maintain and update your website. You can modify the styling without altering the underlying content.

**Browser Default Styles**:

- Browsers apply default styles to HTML elements to ensure basic readability even if no explicit styling is specified.
- However, using CSS, you can create custom designs that go beyond these defaults.

**Examples of CSS Usage**:

- Basic text styling: Change font color, size, and spacing.
- Layout: Create multi-column layouts, sidebars, and responsive designs.
- Effects: Add animations, transitions, and hover effects.
